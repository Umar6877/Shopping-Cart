## README for ZalanteWear GitHub Pages Shopping Cart

This repository contains the code for a shopping cart website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a product shop with individual product descriptions and prices, a cart that updates dynamically with added items, and basic checkout functionality.

**Features:**

- Product listing with images, descriptions, and prices
- Add items to cart and update quantities
- View cart contents and total price
- Print or clear cart
- Basic checkout functionality

**Technologies:**

- HTML: Document structure and content
- CSS: Styling and layout
- JavaScript: Interactivity and dynamic behavior

**Instructions:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/umar6877/shopping-cart.git
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

No external dependencies are required.

3. **Start the development server:**

Open `index.html` in your web browser, or start a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server` in the project directory) and access the website through the server address.

4. **Customize the shop:**

- Edit the `shopData.js` file to change product information like images, descriptions, and prices.
- Modify the CSS styles in `style.css` to personalize the look and feel of the website.

**Deployment:**

- To deploy the website live, you can use services like GitHub Pages or Netlify. These platforms will automatically build and host the website from your GitHub repository.


**Additional Notes:**

- This is a basic implementation and can be further extended with features like payment processing, user accounts, and product filtering.
- The code uses localStorage to store cart items temporarily. For a more robust solution, consider using a database or server-side storage.

I hope this README provides a clear overview of the ZalanteWear shopping cart website. Feel free to ask any questions or contribute to the project!
